Python interface to MySQL
=========================

mysqlclient is a fork of MySQL-python. It adds Python 3.3~ support
and merges some pull requests.

MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL_ database server for
Python. The design goals are:

- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]_
- Thread-safety
- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-4.1 through 5.5 and Python-2.7, 3.3-3.5 are currently
supported. PyPy is supported.

MySQLdb is `Free Software`_.
